<p>The <strong>Department of  Women's Studies</strong> is implementing a new curriculum effective <br />
  Fall 2011-12.</p>
<p>We are holding a town hall meeting the first week of Fall quarter to address questions from all undergraduate students (continuing and new) on the implications of the change. </p>
<h3>Monday, September 26th 12-2pm, Royce 314</h3>
<p><strong>New Curriculum:</strong> <br />
  <a href="#">Continuing Majors</a>  |  <a href="#">Continuing Minors</a>  |  <a href="#">Entering Students</a><br />
</p>
<h2>SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
  The Department of Women's Studies provides interdisciplinary academic programs that are both nationally and transnationally oriented. The undergraduate program offers a Bachelor of Arts degree and a minor; the graduate program offers Master of Arts (for Ph.D. students only, no terminal Master's) and Ph.D. degrees. 
<p>Students develop critical reasoning and analytical skills, a deep appreciations for complexities of power and asymmetries in gender relations across time, class, and cultures, and conceptual tools for social change.</p>
<p>The Women's Studies curriculum challenges the pervasive theory/practice divide within the academy.  In both our undergraduate and graduate courses, we teach students a broad range of methodological and analytical skills. Core undergraduate courses contextualize foundational theories and key analytic concepts within the study of different historical periods and social movements.  In designating these courses &quot;Power,&quot; &quot;Knowledge,&quot; and &quot;Bodies,&quot; we identify three primary areas in which feminist inquiry has has been concentrated over time, enabling students to trace grounding concepts, key controversies, and the emergence of new theoretical paradigms.</p>
<p>Women's Studies at UCLA has long enjoyed recognition for its strengths in areas including women's history, feminist science studies, Middle East women's studies, and gender and the law.  Over the past several years. The Department has become a leading center for interdisciplinary intersectional feminist scholarship on gender, sexuality, race, class, and nationality, and is building a strong reputation in areas of transnational literary and media studies, postcolonial feminist studies, and studies of settler colonialism.</p>
<h2>WORK, CAREERS AND CONTINUING EDUCATION</h2>
<p>  A background in Women's Studies offers unique contextual perspectives for today's shifting gender norms in the work place. It prepares students for a wide range of career and life choices, as well as for advanced study. Most students who graduate with the major or the specialization continue their education in graduate or professional study. They go on to careers in public service and private industry, in law, health professions, government and politics, business, teaching, social services and more. A program in Women's Studies in well suited to careers requiring skill in thinking, writing, planning, analyzing and innovating.</p>

<p>Of course, a Women's Studies background is also excellent preparation for entering a Women's Studies Graduate program! For several handy databases listing institutions offering advanced degrees in Women's Studies, please consult our links page - and of course don't forget to visit our own Graduate Program site!</p>
<h2>EDUCATION ABROAD PROGRAM (EAP)</h2><p>
  The Program encourages its major and minor students to participate in the University of California's Education Abroad Program. Students are able to take Women's Studies courses and receive UC credit at over two dozen universities in countries such as Korea, Hungary and Brazil. Studying abroad enables students to gain a greater understanding of issues relevant across cultures and societies. Adding an international dimension to students' education also enhances their career opportunities. Explore the options for study through EAP on UCLA's web site or view faculty recommendations of specific opportunities for Women's Studies students on the university-wide EAP site. Some of our Women's Studies students have indeed traveled to the UK, Chile, France, India in the past couple of years.</p>
